# sublimeTextAndP5JS
practice with sublime text IDE and p5js

Date: May 15th 2020; W20; Third Quarter

The purpose of this repository is to contain my practice projects for p5js.  I'll be using a new IDE, sublime text as it has been suggested for p5js.  I think I will use a native python server as well.  My goal is to be able to post some finished projects to my projects web page.
